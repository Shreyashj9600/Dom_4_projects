This repository features a collection of four hands-on projects built using Vanilla JavaScript with a strong focus on DOM manipulation and interactive UI development. Each project is designed to strengthen core JavaScript skills and demonstrate the power of dynamically updating web content using the Document Object Model (DOM).
